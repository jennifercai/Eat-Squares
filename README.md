# Verilog-Agario
Created by Jennifer Cai & Elena Huang

A game made using Verilog and DE1-SOC.
This project is inspired by Agario. In this version of the game, the player is represented by a square, and needs to dodge larger squares while eating smaller squares. When the player collides with a square of a bigger size, the player gets eaten and the game ends. On the other hand, if the size of the player is bigger than the size of the square in the collision, the player grows bigger and gains score. The player also gains passive points for staying alive. In gameplay, the user uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to move, and can toggle the switches of the DE1-SoC board to change the color of the enemies.
